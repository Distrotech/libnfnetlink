It\r\nprovides a unified kernel/userspace interface for the various netfilter\r\nsubsystems, such as connection tracking, logging and queueing.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is libnfnetlink?\r\n\r\nlibnfnetlink is a userspace library that provides some low-level\r\nnfnetlink handling functions.  It is used as a foundation for other, netfilter\r\nsubsystem specific libraries such as libnfnetlink_conntrack, libnfnetlink_log\r\nand libnfnetlink_queue.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequirements for libnfnetlink\r\n\r\nYou will need kernel headers from a kernel that has nfnetlink support.  The\r\nfirst official kernel release to include nfnetlink support is 2.6.14.  \r\nYou can specify the location of your kernel sources using the \"--with-kernel=\"\r\nconfigure option.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere can I find documentation?\r\n\r\nAt the moment, you will have to RTFS.  Sorry, but we have barely enough\r\nmanpower to keep development ongoing.  If you want to conribute documentation,\r\nplease contact us.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has bugs.  Where do I report them?\r\n\r\nPlease report all libnfnetlink bugs to https://bugzilla.netfilter.org/, using\r\nthe \"libnfnetlink\" Product.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n\r\nThis library is released under GPLv2+.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere do I get support?\r\n\r\nThe netfilter@lists.netfilter.org and netfilter-devel@lists.netfilter.org\r\nmailinglists server as support forum.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
